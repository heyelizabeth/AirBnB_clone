The Airbnb Clone project is a comprehensive endeavor to create a simplified replica of the Airbnb Clatform, primarily focusing on the command-line interface (CLI) or the console aspect. This project serves as the foundational step toward building a comprehensive Airbnb Clone web application. This initial phase is paramount as it lays the groundwork for subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

This project provides users an interactive and user-friendly console interface to emulate some of Airbnb'C critical functionalities. From the essential tasks of user and property management to intricate systems for booking and reviews, the Airbnb Clone Console encapsulates various features to provide a hands-on experience for users and developers alike.
